                <h4 class="mb-4">Testing - Overview</h4>
                <p> Our development process was underpinned by a comprehensive testing strategy, ensuring both the
                    backend and frontend components of our application met stringent quality standards. OpenPhysio is a data transferring and storing medical technology, therefore it is necessary to produce thorough tests to ensure itâ€™s usability, accuracy and effectiveness matches our moSCoW requirements. </p>

                        <h5>Test Scope</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>FHIR is the data transferral standard commonly used by health practitioners. As the project relies heavily on transferring medical data then it is crucial that the ability of the software to transfer data- in line with these standards- should be tested. This ensures that the data is both transferred correctly but also in line with the industry standard.</li>
                            <li>As it is medical practitioners who will be the primary users of the software, testing that the user experience is comfortable and the interface is similar to healthcare norms is vital to the sleek integration of the project into service.</li>
                            <li>The aim of the project is to provide a succinct yet comprehensive view of patient performance. Therefore, testing the efficacy of its ability to provide the user with a visualization of patient improvement over time must be conducted.</li>
                        </ol>


                <p>In the backend, we adopted a Test-Driven Development methodology, which played a pivotal role in
                    shaping our core functionality. This approach involved writing <b>detailed unit tests</b> prior to
                    developing functional code, establishing a robust foundation for our backend services. Through this
                    rigorous process, we were able to identify and address potential issues early in the development
                    cycle, enhancing code reliability and maintainability. Test-Driven Development also benefitted the development through allowing the developer to consider the purpose of each unit in the wider context of its subsystem. This also allowed for the precise consideration of the exact specifications of each function before the development process. The team continually adapted the backend to pass all unit tests and extending the unit tests when more functionality was required. </p>

                <p>For the frontend, our strategy encompassed an exhaustive <b>User Acceptance Testing </b>regimen,
                    aimed at
                    ensuring the user interface aligned perfectly with end-user expectations and usability standards. An
                    integral part of our frontend testing was dedicated to <b>responsive design testing</b>, where we
                    meticulously tested the application across a spectrum of devices and screen
                    sizes. This responsive design testing was instrumental in confirming that our application adapted
                    gracefully to different viewing contexts, providing an optimal user experience regardless of device
                    or browser.</p>

                <p>The user acceptance testing process for the frontend not only assessed functional correctness and
                    user interaction but also placed a strong emphasis on the application's aesthetic adaptability and
                    responsiveness. By rigorously testing and fine-tuning the UI/UX across diverse environments, we
                    ensured our application was accessible, intuitive, and engaging for physiotherapists, and <b>in line
                        with NHS standards</b>.</p>

                <p>Following the successful validation of individual backend and frontend components, we moved to the
                    integration phase, where these components were synergized to function as a cohesive unit.
                    Once they had been integrated, they needed to be tested. It made the most sense to test these manually as synthetic data had been generated and the functionality of the site was predetermined- therefore it was a matter of testing whether the frontend could accurately display the stored data and transfer input to the backend for processing and storage. </p>

                <p>The team is very happy with the feedback and, through user acceptance, it has become clear that there is enthusiasm towards deploying the software to production. All of the teams internal tests were passed and in good time, partly due to large efforts during coding sprints, and the user acceptance tests generated feedback which proved to be invaluable.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-4">User Acceptance Testing</h4>
                    <p>User Acceptance Testing played an integral role in the frontend development of our healthcare
                        application. This phase was engineered to validate the application against real-world scenarios
                        and user requirements, ensuring that every UI component resonated with the practical needs of
                        healthcare professionals.</p>
                    <p>During user acceptance testing, we engaged with a diverse group of physiotherapists, to interact
                        with the application in a staged environment that simulated their daily operational settings.
                        This process involved executing predefined test cases that covered a broad spectrum of
                        functionalities, including patient data entry, retrieval of past consultation details, and the
                        generation and export of reports.</p>
                        <h5>Key Elements of User Acceptance Testing included:</h5>
                        <ul class="list-marked">
                            <li><strong>Functionality Testing:</strong> We conducted functionality tests, like entering consultation numbers or selecting SNOMED codes, to verify each function performed as expected. The rationale behind these tests was to ensure operational integrity across all user actions, including navigation, data manipulation, and report generation. We used automated test scripts and manual testing methods. The results confirmed that all functions operated correctly, leading to the conclusion that the system's functional aspects are robust and reliable.</li>
                        
                            <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Usability tests assessed how intuitively users could interact with UI elements such as buttons, dropdowns, and text inputs. The objective was to verify the system's ease of use and efficiency in task completion. Using heuristic evaluation methods and user feedback sessions as our tools, we analyzed the interaction patterns and identified areas for improvement. The positive feedback and minimal user-reported issues led to the conclusion that the UI is user-friendly and efficient.</li>
                        
                            <li><strong>Data Accuracy Testing:</strong> We focused on verifying the precision of data presented in consultation tables and trend charts. The purpose was to ensure that the system displays accurate and reliable data, which is crucial for user trust and decision-making. Through manual data validation techniques, we examined the data integrity. The tests showed high accuracy levels in data representation, affirming the system's credibility in data handling.</li>
                        
                            <li><strong>Error Handling Testing:</strong> Testing the application's response to incorrect inputs or actions was pivotal in evaluating its robustness. This included inputs of non-numeric values for consultation numbers or SNOMED codes and tests on mandatory fields like 'Problem Description.' The goal was to ascertain that the system gracefully handles errors, guiding the user towards correct usage. Utilizing boundary value analysis and negative testing techniques, we identified the system's behavior under various error conditions. The outcomes demonstrated effective error handling and user guidance, reinforcing the system's reliability and user-centric design.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                    <p>Feedback from User Acceptance Testing was invaluable, leading to several iterative enhancements
                        that optimized the workflow and user experience. For the final system, it was strongly believed by test users that the system was highly in line with NHS standards, yet far more intuitive to use.

                    <h4 class="mb-4">Responsive Design Testing</h4>
                    <p>Responsive Design Testing was critical in ensuring our application's interface was optimized for
                        various devices, screen sizes, and orientations. Given the diverse nature of device usage in
                        healthcare settings, from desktop computers to tablets, our application needed to be highly
                        flexible and adaptive.
                    </p>
                    <p>The testing process included: </p>
                    <ul class="list-marked">
                        <li><strong>Layout Fluidity Testing:</strong> To ensure optimal viewing across diverse devices, we tested layout adjustments across different screen sizes. The focus was on ensuring elements like the consultation data table and trend chart resized and repositioned without loss of readability or functionality. Using responsive design testing tools and manual resizing, we evaluated fluidity. The results confirmed that our layout adapts effectively to various screen sizes (ipad and larger, as this application is not intended for phone use), maintaining functionality and aesthetic quality across devices.</li>
                    
                        <li><strong>Touch Interactions Testing:</strong> Recognizing the importance of touch interaction on mobile devices, we assessed the responsiveness of dropdowns and buttons to ensure they were easily selectable. Our methodology involved real-device testing and emulator simulations to mimic user interactions. The findings indicated that all touchable elements provided appropriate feedback and were easily navigable, enhancing the user experience on touch devices.</li>
                    
                        <li><strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing:</strong> To guarantee a consistent user experience across platforms, the application underwent rigorous testing on multiple browsers. We focused on ensuring that visual elements like the 'DOWNLOAD FULL DATA' buttons rendered correctly. Tools like BrowserStack and manual testing across actual devices were employed. The outcome was positive, with the application showing consistent performance and appearance across tested browsers, confirming its cross-browser compatibility.</li>
                    
                        <li><strong>Performance Testing:</strong> The efficiency of the application, especially the rendering times of trend charts, was scrutinized to ensure quick and smooth loading across all devices. Utilizing performance measurement tools and manual testing, we assessed the responsiveness and interactive features such as tooltips on hover. The tests demonstrated that the application maintains high performance, with minimal loading times and no loss of interactivity, regardless of the device or platform.</li>
                    
                        <li><strong>Orientation Change Adaptability Testing:</strong> The application's adaptability to orientation changes on tablets was critically verified to ensure users experience seamless transitions between landscape and portrait modes. Through hands-on testing on various tablets, we evaluated the responsiveness and layout integrity during orientation changes. The results confirmed that our application successfully adjusts to both orientations, providing a consistent and engaging user experience.</li>
