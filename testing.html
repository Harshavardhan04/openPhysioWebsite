                <h4 class="mb-4">Testing - Overview</h4>
                <p> Our development process was underpinned by a comprehensive testing strategy, ensuring both the
                    backend and frontend components of our application met stringent quality standards. OpenPhysio is a data transferring and storing medical technology, therefore it is necessary to produce thorough tests to ensure itâ€™s usability, accuracy and effectiveness matches our moSCoW requirements. </p>

                        <h5>Test Scope</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>FHIR is the data transferral standard commonly used by health practitioners. As the project relies heavily on transferring medical data then it is crucial that the ability of the software to transfer data- in line with these standards- should be tested. This ensures that the data is both transferred correctly but also in line with the industry standard.</li>
                            <li>As it is medical practitioners who will be the primary users of the software, testing that the user experience is comfortable and the interface is similar to healthcare norms is vital to the sleek integration of the project into service.</li>
                            <li>The aim of the project is to provide a succinct yet comprehensive view of patient performance. Therefore, testing the efficacy of its ability to provide the user with a visualization of patient improvement over time must be conducted.</li>
                        </ol>


                <p>In the backend, we adopted a Test-Driven Development methodology, which played a pivotal role in
                    shaping our core functionality. This approach involved writing <b>detailed unit tests</b> prior to
                    developing functional code, establishing a robust foundation for our backend services. Through this
                    rigorous process, we were able to identify and address potential issues early in the development
                    cycle, enhancing code reliability and maintainability. Test-Driven Development also benefitted the development through allowing the developer to consider the purpose of each unit in the wider context of its subsystem. This also allowed for the precise consideration of the exact specifications of each function before the development process. The team continually adapted the backend to pass all unit tests and extending the unit tests when more functionality was required. </p>

                <p>For the frontend, our strategy encompassed an exhaustive <b>User Acceptance Testing </b>regimen,
                    aimed at
                    ensuring the user interface aligned perfectly with end-user expectations and usability standards. An
                    integral part of our frontend testing was dedicated to <b>responsive design testing</b>, where we
                    meticulously tested the application across a spectrum of devices and screen
                    sizes. This responsive design testing was instrumental in confirming that our application adapted
                    gracefully to different viewing contexts, providing an optimal user experience regardless of device
                    or browser.</p>

                <p>The user acceptance testing process for the frontend not only assessed functional correctness and
                    user interaction but also placed a strong emphasis on the application's aesthetic adaptability and
                    responsiveness. By rigorously testing and fine-tuning the UI/UX across diverse environments, we
                    ensured our application was accessible, intuitive, and engaging for physiotherapists, and <b>in line
                        with NHS standards</b>.</p>

                <p>Following the successful validation of individual backend and frontend components, we moved to the
                    integration phase, where these components were synergized to function as a cohesive unit.
                    Once they had been integrated, they needed to be tested. It made the most sense to test these manually as synthetic data had been generated and the functionality of the site was predetermined- therefore it was a matter of testing whether the frontend could accurately display the stored data and transfer input to the backend for processing and storage. </p>

                <p>The team is very happy with the feedback and, through user acceptance, it has become clear that there is enthusiasm towards deploying the software to production. All of the teams internal tests were passed and in good time, partly due to large efforts during coding sprints, and the user acceptance tests generated feedback which proved to be invaluable.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-4">User Acceptance Testing</h4>
                    <p>User Acceptance Testing played an integral role in the frontend development of our healthcare
                        application. This phase was engineered to validate the application against real-world scenarios
                        and user requirements, ensuring that every UI component resonated with the practical needs of
                        healthcare professionals.</p>
                    <p>During user acceptance testing, we engaged with a diverse group of physiotherapists, to interact
                        with the application in a staged environment that simulated their daily operational settings.
                        This process involved executing predefined test cases that covered a broad spectrum of
                        functionalities, including patient data entry, retrieval of past consultation details, and the
                        generation and export of reports.</p>
                    <h5>Key Elements of User Acceptance Testing included:</h5>
                    <ul class="list-marked">
                        <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Each function, like entering consultation numbers or
                            selecting SNOMED codes, was tested to verify that it performed as expected. Actions such as
                            navigating back to the dashboard, adding and removing SNOMED codes, and downloading full
                            data were thoroughly tested to confirm operational integrity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Usability:</strong> The ease with which users could interact with the UI elements,
                            such as buttons, dropdowns, and text inputs, was assessed. The goal was to ensure that users
                            could accomplish their tasks with intuitiveness and efficiency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Accuracy:</strong> The accuracy of data displayed in the consultation tables
                            and the corresponding values in the trend charts was critically examined. Users verified
                            that the observed and desired values reflected correctly and that the data visualization
                            accurately represented their historical trends.</li>
                        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> The application's behavior in response to incorrect inputs
                            or actions was also tested. This included entering non-numeric values for consultation
                            numbers, SNOMED codes, or leaving mandatory fields like the 'Problem Description' empty.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Feedback from User Acceptance Testing was invaluable, leading to several iterative enhancements
                        that optimized the workflow and user experience. This ensured that upon release, the application
                        was not only functionally robust but also aligned with the high usability standards expected by
                        healthcare professionals.</p>

                        various devices, screen sizes, and orientations. Given the diverse nature of device usage in
                        healthcare settings, from desktop computers to tablets, our application needed to be highly
                        flexible and adaptive.
                    </p>
                    <p>The testing process included: </p>
                    <ul class="list-marked">
                        
                        <li><b>Layout fluidity: </b>We tested the layout adjustments across different screen sizes to ensure that elements like
                            the consultation data table and trend chart resized and repositioned correctly. Special
                            attention was given to the consultation data table, ensuring that columns adjusted without
                            compromising readability or functionality.</li>

                        <li><b>Touch Interactions: </b>On touch devices, we focused on elements like dropdowns and buttons to ensure they were
