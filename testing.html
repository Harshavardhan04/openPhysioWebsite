                <h4 class="mb-4">Testing - Overview</h4>
                <p> Our development process was underpinned by a comprehensive testing strategy, ensuring both the
                    backend and frontend components of our application met stringent quality standards.</p>

                <p>In the backend, we adopted a Test-Driven Development methodology, which played a pivotal role in
                    shaping our core functionality. This approach involved writing <b>detailed unit tests</b> prior to
                    developing functional code, establishing a robust foundation for our backend services. Through this
                    rigorous process, we were able to identify and address potential issues early in the development
                    cycle, enhancing code reliability and maintainability. The continuous cycle of testing and code
                    refinement facilitated through test-driven development ensured that our backend logic was thoroughly
                    validated against predefined criteria before integration.</p>

                <p>For the frontend, our strategy encompassed an exhaustive <b>User Acceptance Testing </b>regimen,
                    aimed at
                    ensuring the user interface aligned perfectly with end-user expectations and usability standards. An
                    integral part of our frontend testing was dedicated to <b>responsive design testing</b>, where we
                    meticulously tested the application across a spectrum of devices and screen
                    sizes. This responsive design testing was instrumental in confirming that our application adapted
                    gracefully to different viewing contexts, providing an optimal user experience regardless of device
                    or browser.</p>

                <p>The user acceptance testing process for the frontend not only assessed functional correctness and
                    user interaction but also placed a strong emphasis on the application's aesthetic adaptability and
                    responsiveness. By rigorously testing and fine-tuning the UI/UX across diverse environments, we
                    ensured our application was accessible, intuitive, and engaging for physiotherapists, and <b>in line
                        with NHS standards</b>.</p>

                <p>Following the successful validation of individual backend and frontend components, we moved to the
                    integration phase, where these components were synergized to function as a cohesive unit.
                    Post-integration, we conducted a final round of User Acceptance Testing to verify that the
                    integrated system met all functional requirements, user expectations, and quality standards. This
                    end-to-end testing approach was crucial in unveiling any issues that only manifested in a fully
                    integrated environment, enabling us to deliver a polished and user-validated product.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, our structured and layered testing strategy was pivotal in creating a robust,
                    user-centric application. By emphasizing early testing in the backend and comprehensive user
                    acceptance testing, including responsive design testing in the frontend, we
                    established a solid foundation for delivering a high-quality software product that meets modern
                    standards and user expectations.</p>
