                  <h5>FHIR</h5>
                  <p>
                    As of now, the use of FHIR specifically within physiotherapy applications is not as prominently highlighted or well-documented as in other medical specialties. However, the principles of FHIR's application in physiotherapy align closely with its use in broader healthcare contexts, aiming to enhance interoperability and patient data management.

                    Integrating into the broader medical context, FHIR's impact is more evident in various specialties through specific systems and applications. For example, in oncology, the mCODE (Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) initiative uses FHIR to standardize data for cancer care, facilitating better data sharing and patient management. In the realm of mental health, applications like the Cerner Behavioral Health EHR leverage FHIR to integrate diverse patient data sources, enhancing care coordination and treatment planning.
                    
                    Moreover, in the context of general healthcare, systems like Epic and Cerner, as previously mentioned, employ FHIR extensively. Epic's Share Everywhere feature, for instance, uses FHIR to enable patients to grant doctors outside the Epic system temporary access to their health records, directly benefiting patient care continuity.
                    
                    While these do not specifically reference physiotherapy, they underscore the versatility and potential of FHIR to transform data handling in various medical specialties, including physiotherapy, as the field advances and adopts more digital health technologies.
                    <p>Having had a research on some existing systems which use FHIR, we evaluate a good FHIR-compliant system for physiotherapy by the following features:</p>
                  </p>
                  <div class="list-content">

                    The User Interface (UI) design for our physiotherapy system is a culmination of thoughtful application of established design principles aimed at providing physiotherapists with a tool that is not only powerful but also intuitive and efficient to use. Here's a detailed justification of our design choices:
                  </p>
                  <div class="list-content">
                    <ul class="list-marked">
                      <li><b>Simplicity:</b> Our UI is designed to avoid unnecessary complexity. The clean layout and minimalistic design visible in the screenshots help users focus on the task at hand without being overwhelmed by excessive information or functionality. The straightforward presentation of patient data, with clear labels for SNOMED codes and values, is an example of this principle in action.</li>
                      <li><b>Consistency: </b> Consistency in design creates a more predictable and understandable experience. Throughout the interface, consistent color schemes, button styles, and typography are used. This consistency is visible in the uniformity of interactive elements like dropdowns and buttons ("Tabular View" and "Graphical View" toggles), which follow the same design patterns, reducing the cognitive load for users as they navigate through different parts of the system.</li>
                      <li><b>Visibility:</b> Important information is made visible without cluttering the interface. The dashboard screenshot shows the most crucial information (patient details and latest consultation notes) at the top where it’s readily accessible. In the graphical representation, the trends in patient progress are immediately apparent, making it easy for a physiotherapist to assess at a glance.</li>
                      <li><b>Feedback: </b> Feedback is essential to interact with any system. Our UI provides immediate feedback upon user interaction. For example, when a physiotherapist selects a different view or a specific SNOMED code, the system responds instantly by updating the display accordingly. This immediate response lets users know their actions have been registered.</li>
                      <li><b>Tolerance: </b> Our system is tolerant of errors, providing easy ways to correct them. The ability to easily switch between "Tabular" and "Graphical" views allows users to navigate between detailed data and visual representations without penalty or confusion, accommodating different preferences or accidental clicks.</li>
                        <li><b>Affordance: </b> Elements are designed so that they are intuitively understood in terms of their functionality. For instance, buttons for downloading data are placed right next to the data points they relate to, making it clear what action will be taken when they are clicked.</li>
                        <li><b>User Centric Design: </b> The design is tailored for physiotherapists who need quick access to patient data and trends. The graphical view, for instance, provides an immediate visual representation of a patient’s progress over time, which is a vital feature for tracking rehabilitation outcomes.</li>
                        <li><b>Accessibility: </b>Accessibility features are incorporated to ensure that the UI is usable by all physiotherapists, including those with disabilities. Adequate color contrast, as shown in the screenshots, ensures readability for users with visual impairments.</li>
                        <li><b>Efficiency: </b>Efficiency is key for busy professionals. The "Show More Past Data" button is a direct call to action that provides more detailed historical data on demand, allowing physiotherapists to quickly access extended patient histories when needed without navigating away from the dashboard.</li>

                    <p>The final UI designs, as shown in the attached screenshots, are a direct reflection of these principles. The blue color theme is calm and professional, aligning with healthcare settings, while the ample white space prevents information overload. The layout is strategically organized, with the most frequently used information placed prominently for easy access, facilitating a smooth workflow for physiotherapists who would be using the system in potentially fast-paced environments.</p>
