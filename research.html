                            <h5>FHIR</h5>
                            <p>
                                As of now, the use of FHIR specifically within physiotherapy applications is not as
                                prominently highlighted or well-documented as in other medical specialties. However, the
                                principles of FHIR's application in physiotherapy align closely with its use in broader
                                healthcare contexts, aiming to enhance interoperability and patient data management.

                                Integrating into the broader medical context, FHIR's impact is more evident in various
                                specialties through specific systems and applications. For example, in oncology, the
                                mCODE (Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) initiative uses FHIR to standardize data
                                for cancer care, facilitating better data sharing and patient management. In the realm
                                of mental health, applications like the Cerner Behavioral Health EHR leverage FHIR to
                                integrate diverse patient data sources, enhancing care coordination and treatment
                                planning.

                                Moreover, in the context of general healthcare, systems like Epic and Cerner, as
                                previously mentioned, employ FHIR extensively. Epic's Share Everywhere feature, for
                                instance, uses FHIR to enable patients to grant doctors outside the Epic system
                                temporary access to their health records, directly benefiting patient care continuity.

                                While these do not specifically reference physiotherapy, they underscore the versatility
                                and potential of FHIR to transform data handling in various medical specialties,
                                including physiotherapy, as the field advances and adopts more digital health
                                technologies.

                            <h5>Analysis of the NHS's Current Statistical Analysis Tool</h5>
                        <p>
                            The closest project we could find is the statistical analysis tool that the NHS currently uses. This is based on Excel; it is an analytical technique for plotting data over time and helps specialists view the changes over time through a graphical representation. Yet, there are some issues evident:
                        </p>
                        <ol style="color: #555;">
                            <li>The interface suffers from <b>excessive clutter</b>, presenting an overwhelming amount of information on a single page. This could be particularly perplexing for users unfamiliar with the system, potentially hindering their ability to navigate and comprehend the interface effectively.</li>
                            <li>The system's <b>learnability appears to be somewhat challenging</b> due to the assumption of pre-existing knowledge about statistical analysis, which may not be readily available to doctors. Additionally, the absence of prompts within the system on initial steps or a clear workflow creates a lack of guidance. This deficiency in a structured flow potentially complicates the user experience, making it more challenging for users to grasp how to navigate and utilize the system effectively.
                            </li>
                            <li>The <b>absence of any notes associated with data points</b> presents a challenge, as it hinders the comprehensive understanding of what each data point signifies. This deficiency not only makes it difficult to discern the significance of the data but also overlooks crucial qualitative details that are essential for making informed decisions.
                            </li>
                            <li>The system is <b>reliant on Excel</b>, a software that may not be the most user-friendly and readable for all users. One notable challenge is the necessity to save data manually at every step, introducing potential data integrity issues. Additionally, the requirement for a separate Excel document for each patient contributes to organizational difficulties, compelling users to locate and manage individual patient files. 
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <div class="image-container text-center mt-4">

                        <p>Moving to a web app presents a viable solution to these challenges. The backend of a web app can adeptly manage data-saving processes, eliminating the need for manual interventions. Additionally, the system can efficiently centralize patient information, eliminating the cumbersome task of juggling individual Excel documents for each patient. Moreover, the web app facilitates a more organized presentation by segregating information and data systematically, enhancing both the learnability and visual appeal of the UI. This strategic arrangement contributes to an intuitive user experience, making the statistical analysis tool more accessible and user-friendly. In essence, the transition not only streamlines workflow but also significantly elevates the overall quality of user interaction with the system.

                            <p>Physiotherapists use SNOMED CT codes to standardize and categorize clinical information within their practice. By utilizing these codes, physiotherapists can ensure consistency and interoperability in documenting and sharing patient data within Electronic Health Records (EHRs).
                                    </p><p>
 

                                SNOMED CT codes offer a standardized language that facilitates effective communication among healthcare professionals, enabling accurate representation of physiotherapy assessments, interventions, and outcomes. This standardized approach not only enhances the clarity and precision of clinical documentation but also supports the exchange of information across different healthcare settings and systems.
                                
                            </p><p>
                                In our system the SNOMED CT codes are primarily used to identify the body part that the physiotherapist is treating. </p>

                                <h5>LOINC Codes</h5>
                                <p>LOINC serves as a universal language comprising identifiers, names, and codes for categorizing health measurements, observations, and documents. It encompasses a comprehensive repository of measurements, ranging from laboratory tests to clinical indicators like vital signs and anthropometric measures, as well as standardized survey instruments and more.
                                </p><p>
                                    In our system, the LOINC codes are primarily used for standardizing the units of measurement of the values recorded by physiotherapists during their sessions. This decision was made collaboratively through discussions with the physiotherapists themselves. By incorporating LOINC codes into our system, we ensure consistency and interoperability in the documentation of patient assessments, facilitating seamless communication and data exchange among healthcare professionals.</p>
                                    <p>FHIR.resources also demands that LOINC codes are stored, another reason why we decided to add them.</p>

                            <h5>Overview</h5>
                            <p>In the quest to choose a robust frontend framework for a healthcare application, we
                                evaluated React alongside its notable peers: Angular, Vue.js, and Svelte. This
                                comparison delved into metrics such as community size, performance benchmarks, bundle
                                size, and learning curve, all while keeping an eye on the specialized demands of
                                healthcare systems, such as data handling efficiency and interface responsiveness.

                            </p>
                            <h5>Community Support and Ecosystem</h5>
                            <p>React's community is expansive, with millions of developers contributing to its growth.
                                According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, React has consistently been among the
                                most loved and wanted frameworks. In terms of quantitative measures, React boasts a vast
                                npm ecosystem with over 1.6 million downloads weekly, far surpassing Vue.js's 350,000
                                and Angular's 300,000, indicative of its widespread adoption and support.</p>
                            <h5>Performance Metrics</h5>
                            <p>Performance is a non-negotiable in healthcare applications, which often require handling
                                complex datasets and rendering dynamic UIs efficiently. Benchmarks on update handling
                                and rendering speeds show React excelling due to its virtual DOM. In real-world
                                scenarios, this translates to a smoother experience, as React updates only what's
                                necessary, without refreshing the entire view. Frameworks like Angular and Vue.js, while
                                performant, still lag slightly behind in this aspect, as indicated by various
                                independent benchmarks such as the js-framework-benchmark.</p>
                            <h5>Bundle Size and Load Times</h5>
                            <p>React's minimalistic approach yields a smaller initial bundle size, with an average gzip
                                size of 45KB, compared to Angular's 500KB and Vue's 80KB. This ensures a faster load
                                time, which is particularly crucial in healthcare settings where time is of the essence.
                                Moreover, tools like Create React App and React.lazy() facilitate code-splitting,
                                enabling even more efficient load times.</p>
                            <h5>Adoption and Stability in Enterprise</h5>
                            <p>React's adoption by industry giants such as Facebook, Instagram, and Airbnb speaks
                                volumes about its reliability and scalability. In contrast, while Google backs Angular,
                                the frequent major updates often lead to instability. Vue, despite its impressive
                                adaptability, doesn't enjoy the same level of enterprise adoption, which raises concerns
                                about long-term viability. Svelte, though innovative, lacks the track record in
                                enterprise scenarios.</p>
                            <h5>Security Concerns</h5>
                            <p>Security is pivotal, and React's architecture inherently promotes secure coding practices
                                by escaping HTML by default and preventing XSS attacks. In terms of quantitative
                                analysis, React projects report fewer security vulnerabilities on average in Snyk's
                                vulnerability database compared to Angular and Vue.js, which can be attributed to
                                React's focused API and less magic behind the scenes.</p>
                            <h5>Ease of Development and Learning Curve</h5>
                            <p>React's learning curve is relatively mild, with its JSX syntax being intuitive for those
                                with a basic understanding of JavaScript and HTML. Onboarding developers can ramp up
                                quickly, a crucial factor for scaling development teams in project-critical phases.
                                Angular's complexity and TypeScript requirement can prolong the onboarding process,
                                while Vue's simplicity in smaller projects does not always translate well to complex
                                enterprise applications.
                            <h5>Summary</h5>
                            <p>Quantitatively and qualitatively, React stands out as the most fitting choice for our
                                frontend development. Its performance, bolstered by an extensive ecosystem, along with a
                                proven track record in both community and enterprise spheres, offers the reliability and
                                efficiency we require. The balance between ease of use, performance, and security makes
                                React not just a safe bet, but a strategic advantage for our healthcare application
                                development.

                    <p style = "text-align: justify;">For the backend the research required significant consideration for both the language and the supporting libraries. The main contenders for languages were Java and Python. Java due to it’s well known support for the creation of FHIR servers and python for it’s high rate of development. The backend developer was familiar with both python and Java but with a slight preference for Python due to higher readability and familiarity with using python testing software- this was taken into account when deciding on which language to program the backend with, alongside how using Java would have hindered the rate of integration between frontend and backend due to the familiarity of both programmers and the languages higher syntax requirement. However, the most important factor was the supporting libraries available. Python had Fhir.resources, this was enticing because it allowed for the readable and validating creation of FHIR compliant objects for the purpose of transporting patient data from the frontend to the backend. On the other hand, the online documentation was limited. Java’s best option was HAPI fhir which was very well documented but would’ve required a slightly larger amount time spent developing and reacquainting with Java. The constraint of fewer documentation with Fhir.resources alongside a slower run time compared to a Java implementation was weighed up against the increased rate of development and integration of python due it being a higher level language- resulting in the latter outweighing the former and the team choosing to continue with python. </p>
